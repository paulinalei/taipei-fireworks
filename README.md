Trying out Node.js, Express.js, Jade, Processing.js, and animations.

## Running the project
* git clone (repository url)
* Install Node.js
* Install Node package nodemon
* From the command line:
  * To get a localhost going, type command `nodemon bin/www`, then go to any localhost number on your browser. I use `localhost: 3000`

## How to set-up
* Install Node.js
* From the command line:
  * Use Node package manager to install Express.js with command `npm install -g express`
  * Create a new folder with Express.js with command `express (folder name)`
  * cd into new folder then use command `npm install`
  * Install nodemon with command `npm install nodemon -g`
    * This will let you refresh when you make changes without having to restart the server
  * Use command `nodemon bin/www` then go to any localhost, or just `localhost: 3000`
