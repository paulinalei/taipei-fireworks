Trying out Node.js, Express.js, Jade, Paper.js, and animations.

## Set-up
* git clone (repository url)
* Install Node.js
* From the command line:
  * Use Node package manager to install Express.js  with command `npm install -g express`
  * Create a new folder with express with command `express (folder name)`
  * cd into new folder then use command `npm install`
  * Install nodemon with command `npm install nodemon -g`. This will let you refresh when you make changes without having to restart the server.
  * To get a localhost going, type command `node bin/www`, then go to any localhost number on your browser. I use `localhost: 3000`
